We migrated the data from firestore to realtime database
Screenshot.pdf shows the basic application flow

We were yet to implement the cancellation logic + tickets of the user
 
however other functionalities like-
[] search
[] book upto 4 tickets with name and age 
[] user db generation 
[] user ticket integration in booked array
[] seats reduction on booking 
[] sign out which redirects to index.html i.e back to sign in it was done using firebase.auth()
[] 
Db JSON file is in the main directory
 schema is in images too
